# WeaveSlicer
WeaveSlicer is a slicer optimized for 3D printing clay that enables designers to print a large range of geometry. Dramatic angles in a form cause clay prints generated by traditional slicers to collapse. WeaveSlicer increases the structural stability of clay 3D prints by generating prints with walls of uniform thickness.

This is a grasshopper version of the library. For a newer Python version of the library see: https://handandmachine.org/projects/weave_slicer_python/
