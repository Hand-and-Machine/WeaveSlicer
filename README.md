# WeaveSlicer
WeaveSlicer is a slicer optimized for 3D printing in clay that enables designers to print a large range of geometry. Dramatic angles in a form cause clay prints generated by traditional slicers to collapse. WeaveSlicer increases the structural stability of clay 3D prints by generating prints with walls of uniform thickness. For more information see:
